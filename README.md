# AdventOfCode2020
A place for my solutions to the December 2020 advent of code event: https://adventofcode.com/

This repo is also represents my first attempts at teaching myself eclipse (and IDE) and Java Swing (a GUI toolkit). 
The solutions to each day of the Advent of Code are currently single methods in AdventSolverApp.java, labeled like: dayFiveMainOne() , for the first puzzle on day five of the advent of code calendar.
